GNURadio-mmWave
================================

This GNURadio framework is based on the work proposed in the paper:

A. Schott, A. Ichkov, B. Acikgöz, N. Beckmann, L. Reiher, L. Simić, “A Multi-Band mm-Wave Experimental Platform Towards Environment-Aware Beam Management in the Beyond-5G Era”, submitted to ACM WiNTECH 2024

We estimate the code to be finalized and released in mid-November.
